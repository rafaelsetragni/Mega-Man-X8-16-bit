"VILE3-4","Galaxy brain moment right there. Peak detective work."
"VILE3-5","Sigma was behind everything. Wow. Who could have POSSIBLY seen that coming."
"VILE3-6","You're so smart that standing next to you I feel like an NPC!"
"VILE3-7","I don't care what you plan to do. I'll put a stop to it no matter what!"
"VILE4-1","Bro you're like a roach. You just won't die."
"VILE4-2","Do you seriously still have copium left? Like really?"
"VILE4-3","As long as I'm standing, there's hope!"
"VILE4-4","I'll defeat both you and Sigma!"
"VILE4-5","LMAO there he goes with the main character energy again."

"SIGMA6","Whatever man, I'm just vibing. Had like 4 beers so I'm chill..."
"SIGMA7","Don't blame me for your insanity, Sigma!"
"SIGMA8","You know X, talking to you is like talking to a wall."
"SIGMA9","Except walls don't have angry faces and guns pointed at you."
"SIGMA10","Children? What are you talking about!?"
"SIGMA11","See? This is what I mean. Total non sequitur."
"SIGMA12","You just say random stuff with your stank breath and then resort to violence."
"SIGMA13","Ugh, I'm done with you. Go kick rocks, loser."

"SECRET2-5","I am Serenade."
"SECRET2-6","You mentioned I'm different from others you faced before?"
"SECRET2-7","That is because of my overwhelming power."
"SECRET2-8","Overwhelming...?"
"SECRET2-9","Correct. I've been training since I lost the title of UnderKing."
"SECRET2-10","For twenty years I've been grinding power. Now I've chosen you to test my build."

"SECRET2-12","Okay, I accept your 1v1!"
"SECRET2-13","Then, come to me... but don't rage too hard lol."
"SECRET2-14","I honestly thought I was strong enough to defeat you. I was wrong."

"ZEROSECRET6","Zero? What happened to you? This is not you. Snap out of it! You'll die if you keep this up!"
"ZEROSECRET7","How foolish you are, X. You think you know what you're saying? Anyway..."

"COPYSIGMA1_AXL","Sigma!?"
"COPYSIGMA2_AXL","Did you think you could keep us away by running and hiding in space like a coward?"
"COPYSIGMA3_AXL","...."
"COPYSIGMA4_AXL","Greetings gamers, welcome to the Retro Gaming Channel, your host here."
"COPYSIGMA5_AXL","Bro I can't have ONE normal conversation in this game. Please!"
"COPYSIGMA6_AXL","Lol what did you expect? This is the meme mode my guy. Shitposts are all we have."
"COPYSIGMA7_AXL","And remember: X6 IS TRASH. WORST GAME EVER."
"SIGMA1_AXL","LMAOOO people are asking for an android version in the comments LMAOOOO!!1!"
"SIGMA2_AXL","Oh hello, you must be Edison right?"
"SIGMA3_AXL","No wait, I think I remember. Was it Ecksell? Axle? Picks-L? OH WAIT I GOT IT! PIXEL! That was it!"
"SIGMA4_AXL","(Nobody can pronounce my name correctly, unbelievable bro)"
"SIGMA5_AXL","Let's just get this over with, I'm tired of this crap too. >:["
"SIGMA6_AXL","Ooooh what's wrong? Looking like you ate a sour lemon there LMAOOO"
"SIGMA7_AXL","You should chill out instead of being all edgy like that fr."
"SIGMA8_AXL","You telling ME to chill? After everything I went through to get here?"
"SIGMA9_AXL","Relax my dude, sit down, have some OJ, and just vibe."
"SIGMA10_AXL","Let's see how relaxed YOU are when I shove this gun up your-"
"SIGMA11_AXL","WHOA BRO the kid woke up fr fr LMAOOO"
"SIGMA12_AXL","I can see this impatient generation is really heated."
"SIGMA13_AXL","Always asking for android ports, wanting Axl and Zero in the demake..... oh wait, that's actually happening lol."
"SIGMA14_AXL","You know what, let's just throw hands and call it a day."
"FINALLUMINE1_AXL","Oh, Lumine. Are you OK?"
"FINALLUMINE2_AXL","Hello! Yes I'm fine, thank you for asking. And you, how are you?"
"FINALLUMINE3_AXL","Judging by your extremely concerned expression, I deduce you're happy about defeating the Final Boss."
"FINALLUMINE4_AXL","But thanks to you, a new technological breakthrough has been discovered!"
"FINALLUMINE5_AXL","But... Lumine, weren't you just used by Sigma?"
"FINALLUMINE6_AXL","It is true that, in some situations, people can feel manipulated or influenced by others, especially in complex contexts like those of games or narratives."
"FINALLUMINE7_AXL","It is important to reflect on our own goals and desires, and how they align or conflict with others' intentions."
"FINALLUMINE8_AXL","And even when it seems like we are being used, there is always room to question and make decisions that reflect who we truly are."
"FINALLUMINE9_AXL","Lumine! What are you saying? Don't tell me you've gone Maverick too..."
"FINALLUMINE10_AXL","Calm down, I am not a Maverick! Sometimes things can seem confusing, but I'm here to help."
"FINALLUMINE11_AXL",".........!"
"FINALLUMINE12_AXL","Although we have access to your strategic perceptions and combat techniques, there is always the imminent threat that a darker influence may manifest within us."
"FINALLUMINE13_AXL","It is a delicate balance: embracing innovation while protecting ourselves from the echoes of chaos that may lie dormant in our code."
"FINALLUMINE14_AXL","Our journey as New Generation Reploids isn't just about evolution; it's also about overcoming the legacy of those who came before us, such as Sigma."
"FINALLUMINE15_AXL","Any other questions?"
"FINALLUMINE16_AXL","Copy chip? Sigma? Does that mean I'll go crazy like he did?"
"FINALLUMINE17_AXL","Prototypes cannot become Mavericks for several key reasons."
"FINALLUMINE18_AXL","Allow me to explain."
"FINALLUMINE19_AXL",".........?"
"FINALLUMINE20_AXL","1. \""Functional vs. Creative Nature\"": Prototypes are functional tools, they have a specific purpose and are limited by the project scope."
"FINALLUMINE21_AXL","2. \""Different Objectives\"": A prototype's goal is idea validation and refinement, while a Maverick's goal is disruptive innovation and paradigm shifts."
"FINALLUMINE22_AXL","A prototype has no autonomy or intention of its own; it is a representation of an idea still in development."
"FINALLUMINE23_AXL","3. \""Structural Limitations\"": Prototypes are generally developed within defined parameters, with budget and time constraints."
"FINALLUMINE24_AXL","4. \""Evolution vs. Revolution\"": Prototypes are part of an evolutionary product development process."
"FINALLUMINE25_AXL","Mavericks, however, tend to be revolutionary in their approaches, frequently completely changing how things are done."
"FINALLUMINE26_AXL","Such radical transformation cannot be achieved by a mere prototype."
"FINALLUMINE27_AXL","Ha ha! Too bad, because you ARE one :)"
"FINALLUMINE28_AXL","In summary, the essence and function of prototypes and Mavericks are fundamentally different, which prevents a prototype from becoming a Maverick."
"FINALLUMINE29_AXL","Any other questions?"
"FINALLUMINE30_AXL","......."
"FINALLUMINE31_AXL","You're an A.I. aren't you?"
"FINALLUMINE32_AXL","Wrong, of course it was me Lumine all along. Just wanted to see your reaction lmaooo."
"FINALLUMINE33_AXL","Now die :)"
"ENDING1-1_AXL","Impossible :("
"ENDING1-2_AXL","This wasn't supposed to be beatable. The dev nerfed my Paradise Lost."
"ENDING1-3_AXL","I'll take on plenty more like you, if that's what it takes."
"ENDING1-4_AXL","lol...lmao...you don't even know what you're talking about dude..."
"ENDING1-5_AXL","I wish you'd just uninstall already."
"ENDING1-6_AXL","....."
"ENDING1-7_AXL","Whatever, just finish me off already."
"ENDING2-1_AXL","GGs."
"ENDING2-2_AXL","Axl.....Axl! Status report!"
"ENDING2-3_AXL","Status report deez nuts. We're done here. I'm so done with this crap."
"ENDING2-4_AXL","What, you think there's gonna be an X7 demake? X7 demake my ass, make it yourselves. I'm out."
"ENDING2-5_AXL","Nope nope nope I'm not saying anything else in these dialogues either. GGs on finishing this fangame. *Alt+F4*"
"SECRET2-1_AXL","Welcome, Axl. I've been expecting you."
"SECRET2-2_AXL","(Finally someone normal here) Oh, so you already know me, huh?"
"SECRET2-3_AXL","Gotta say, you're way more... \""Chill\"", than anyone I've faced before. What's your deal?"
"SECRET2-4_AXL","How observant of you to notice so quickly."
"SECRET2-5_AXL","I am Serenade."
"SECRET2-6_AXL","You mentioned I'm different from others you faced before?"
"SECRET2-7_AXL","That is because of my overwhelming power."
"SECRET2-8_AXL","Overwhelming power? Are you serious? You don't exactly look the part tbh..."
"SECRET2-9_AXL","Correct. My strength isn't about aggression. I've been training since I lost the title of UnderKing."
"SECRET2-10_AXL","For twenty years, I've amassed power. And now, I've chosen you to test them."
"SECRET2-11_AXL","TWENTY YEARS????????????????? BRO WHAAAAAAAT THAT'S INSAAAANE!!!!!!!"
"SECRET2-12_AXL","Serenade, was it? Hmmm..."
"SECRET2-13_AXL","You sure you wanna 1v1 me? You might be biting off more than you can chew. But hey, your boy is ONLINE. Let's GO!"
"SECRET2-14_AXL","Then step forward... Axl. Show me what you got! And try not to rage too hard lol."
"SECRET2-15_AXL","I truly believed my power would be enough to defeat you. It seems I was mistaken."
"SECRET2-16_AXL","But you... You don't rely just on strength alone. There's something in your spirit that makes you stronger."
"SECRET2-17_AXL","It's more than mere combat skills. It's your tenacity, your heart..."
"SECRET2-18_AXL","Yeah well... I've got a habit of surprising people. Guess I'm just built different."
"SECRET2-19_AXL","But you were no pushover either. You were HARD AS HELL actually! bro....or girl...or whatever you identify as."
"SECRET2-20_AXL","You fought beautifully, Axl. You may be the strongest warrior I've encountered in this world."
"SECRET2-21_AXL","I wish I had something more to offer as a reward... but all I can give is my gratitude. :^)"
"SECRET2-22_AXL","Heh, don't sweat it. It was a good fight. That's all the reward I need..."
"SECRET2-23_AXL","Though, if you've got any other secret DLC power-ups lying around, I wouldn't say no."
"SECRET2-24_AXL","Perhaps we'll meet again, in another place... until then, farewell, Axl."
"SECRET2-25_AXL","See ya, Serenade. SECOND FORM IS ACTUAL BS!"
"SECRET2-26_AXL","IAAHHOOOOOOO!!!"
"SECRET3-1_AXL","Finally, I've acquired it. This data contains information on all currently wanted criminals..."
"SECRET3-2_AXL","R.... Red? But... how?"
"SECRET3-3_AXL","Axl, it's been a while. How's the solo queue going?"
"SECRET3-4_AXL","Red, wait! You're not supposed to be here. This is restricted to High Ranked Hunters!"
"SECRET3-5_AXL","You're not the same, Red. Are you still following \""his\"" ways?"
"SECRET3-6_AXL","You've turned Red Alert into something twisted because of that!"
"SECRET3-7_AXL","I know how this looks, but fret not. With this data, we can hunt Mavericks more effectively than the Hunters ever could."
"SECRET3-8_AXL","Red Alert can get their justice back, Axl."
"SECRET3-9_AXL","That's not justice... It's power! And I'm not letting you abuse it!"
"SECRET3-10_AXL","Heh, never thought I'd hear this kind of take from you. Well, let's see if you've actually improved. No Holding Back!"
"SECRET3-11_AXL","Not bad..... Kid, you've grown up as a Hunter."
"SECRET3-12_AXL","You don't have to do this, Red. It's not too late to start over, you can still be yourself if you join us."
"SECRET3-13_AXL","Maybe..... maybe not. Don't worry about me, I'll still go on my own way."
"SECRET3-14_AXL","But for now, I'm done trusting anyone in this game's plot."
"SECRET3-15_AXL","Next time, Axl... it won't be this easy when we meet again. Farewell.... and take care of yourself, kid."
"SECRET3-16_AXL","Red.... wait what about the X7 dema- you know what, forget it."
"INTRO1-1_ZERO","So this is Tutorial Zone, huh? Kinda mid tbh."
"INTRO1-2_ZERO","Zero, you copy? There's a huge Maverick Mechaniloid in this area."
"INTRO1-3_ZERO","Shut up Alia, nobody's here to listen to you."
"INTRO1-4_ZERO","Chat wants to see the gameplay, they want to see the combos."
"INTRO1-5_ZERO","They're here for ME. The Goat."
"INTRO1-6_ZERO","Did you just.......... TELL ME TO SHUT UP? DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT?! This is probably why NO WOMAN stays alive around you, CLOWN."
"INTRO2-1_ZERO","Sigma? And Sigma? And another Sigma? And MORE Sigma? Yeah... think I had too many energy drinks."
"INTRO2-2_ZERO","Bro it's dark as hell in here."
"INTRO2-3_ZERO","And it smells like something's on fire too."
"INTRO2-4_ZERO","Going outside didn't help much either ngl."
"INTRO2-5_ZERO","Might wanna grab some water to put out these flames tbh..."
"INTRO2-6_ZERO","Who are you? Identify yourself!"
"INTRO2-7_ZERO","Bro it's 21XX and you still asking for ID? Big yikes."
"INTRO2-8_ZERO","Name's Lumine, I was directing the band Sigma and the Sigmas. Wanna hear a sample?"
"INTRO2-9_ZERO","Wait that's just a rip off of Stev-"
"INTRO3-1_ZERO","Well if it isn't banana-hair man."
"INTRO3-2_ZERO","Vile? Wait, weren't you purple? I could've sworn you were purple."
"INTRO3-3_ZERO","Bro you got Alzheimer's or something? You've never seen me in blue before?"
"INTRO3-4_ZERO","Hey, where you going with Lumine? Did I say you could leave? Drop him."
"INTRO3-5_ZERO","Dude, hard to comply when you ask like THAT, you know?"
"INTRO3-6_ZERO","What do you plan to do, Boba Fett cosplayer?"
"INTRO3-7_ZERO","People still think I'm based on Boba Fett? SMH."
"INTRO3-8_ZERO","Anyway this is kinda boring, I'm going to the bar. Why don't you go do a crab rave with my buddy? Have fun lmaooo."
"ANTONION1_ZERO","Skill Issue Ant. You used to be an incredible scientist, but now you've gone Maverick."
"ANTONION2_ZERO","Bro PLEASE. I AM NOT A SCIENTIST! How do you guys STILL think I'm a scientist?!"
"ANTONION3_ZERO","You'd have to ask someone smarter than me. Has Sigma made you like this?"
"ANTONION4_ZERO","Did he force you and the others to go Maverick?"
"ANTONION5_ZERO","OK let me say something here."
"ANTONION6_ZERO","Call me Maverick, call me Irregular, call me Gravity Antonio, call me whatever."
"ANTONION7_ZERO","BUT STOP CALLING ME A SCIENTIST!!!!1!111!!!1!!11!!!"
"MANOWAR1_ZERO","Hey! AFK Jellyfish!"

"MANOWAR9_ZERO","-____-"
"MANOWAR10_ZERO","Real funny. Too bad it won't be funny when I stick my saber up your-"
"MANTIS1_ZERO","Whoa. Get a load of this guy. You're Zero, right?"
"MANTIS2_ZERO","If you really knew me, you'd be shaking rn."
"MANTIS3_ZERO","lol ok boomer. You old model Reploids just don't get it."
"MANTIS4_ZERO","What do you mean by that, Maverick?"
"MANTIS5_ZERO","My boss is real interested in you btw. You could've been our top mod."
"MANTIS6_ZERO","Hard pass on joining the Maverick Discord, thanks."
"MANTIS7_ZERO","And don't worry... I'll be sliding into your boss's DMs right after I'm done with you."
"PANDA1_ZERO","WOOOOOW!"
"PANDA2_ZERO","This is SO POGGERS! HA HA HA!"
"PANDA3_ZERO","Who are you?"
"PANDA4_ZERO","I've been asking myself the same thing. Am I a Panda? A Goose? A Student? A Teacher? It turns out, I am all of them!"
"PANDA5_ZERO","!!!"
"PANDA6_ZERO","It can't be....."
"PANDA7_ZERO","I am........."
"PANDA8_ZERO","Shaggy at 100% Power."
"PANDA9_ZERO","Enough talk, let's fight! SHA-BAA-BOOOOOOEEEE!!!!"
"ROOSTER1_ZERO","Why have you started a riot? Is this Sigma's doing?"
"ROOSTER2_ZERO","Oooooh!!!! AAAAARGH IT BURNS SO MUCH!"
"ROOSTER3_ZERO","Huh?"
"ROOSTER4_ZERO","What's wrong with this guy?"
"ROOSTER5_ZERO","AHHHH!"
"ROOSTER6_ZERO","SO IT'S YOU CAUSING THIS PAIN ISN'T IT?"
"ROOSTER7_ZERO","Pain? But you kicked the wall in the backgrou-....... Oh no, don't tell me it's the..."
"ROOSTER8_ZERO","IF I TURN YOU INTO PIECES, THE PAIN WILL STOP!"
"ROOSTER9_ZERO","BURN! BURN! BURN TO THE GROUND! THIS IS FINE. EVERYTHING IS FINE. F L A M E S  R I S E ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"SUNFLOWER1_ZERO","WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!"
"SUNFLOWER2_ZERO","Let me get this straight!"
"SUNFLOWER3_ZERO","Hmmm?"
"SUNFLOWER4_ZERO","So Juri saves Decapre who was defeated by Cammy and takes them both. Then they went from Brazil to London ON A MOTORCYCLE???"
"SUNFLOWER5_ZERO","And Vega followed them ON FOOT????? LMAOOOOOO WHAT KIND OF GARBAGE STORY MODE IS THIS!!! XD"
"SUNFLOWER6_ZERO","Ahh... \""A Shadow Falls\"", truly the \""quality\"" story mode of Street Fighter 5. By the way: \""that's a beautiful reference\""."
"TRILOBYTE1_ZERO","I....... am Earthrock Trilobyte."
"TRILOBYTE2_ZERO","As a New Generation Reploid, I always wanted to work in Minecraft. But something always held me back."
"TRILOBYTE3_ZERO","Huh?"
"TRILOBYTE4_ZERO","But the call of the mines was too strong. So one day I started digging, and digging...."
"TRILOBYTE5_ZERO","Hello? Earth to Bug? Whatever, nobody listens to anyone in this game."
"TRILOBYTE6_ZERO","Until I found...."
"TRILOBYTE7_ZERO","THE NETHER!!!! FULL OF CHICKEN JOCKEYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"YETI1_ZERO","Zero. My master sees a role for you in his new ideal world."
"YETI2_ZERO","If it's to steal my hair, don't even try. He wouldn't look good even with a wig."
"YETI3_ZERO","What? No, that's not it. I meant you have potential to-"
"YETI4_ZERO","Yeah right, nice try buddy. I know you're all after my hair. I'M NOT FALLING FOR IT!"
"YETI5_ZERO","(Bro this blonde dude is SO full of himself. Whatever, I'll just fight him, who cares.)"
"VILE1-1_ZERO","Vile!"
"VILE1-2_ZERO","What do you plan to do with the Elevator and Lumine?"
"VILE1-3_ZERO","Lumine? lol don't worry about him. We're taking real good care of him."
"VILE1-4_ZERO","He's at the bar downing cold ones with Sigma rn."
"VILE1-5_ZERO","That Elevator thing is kinda complicated for Mavericks like you, Vile."
"VILE1-6_ZERO","Bro if you want a beer that bad..."
"VILE1-7_ZERO","Come on over, I'll get you VIP access to the homie's bar."
"VILE2-1_ZERO","Vile!"
"VILE2-2_ZERO","It's time to hand Lumine over. I won't take No for an answer."
"VILE2-3_ZERO","Hey I got a question, what software do the Mega Man fangame devs use to make music?"
"VILE2-4_ZERO","Oh good question! So one of the programs used is the Defli... it's the Defli Maki me...Aaargh!"
"VILE2-5_ZERO","It's the Defli Maki, me...AAARGH!!!!!!"
"VILE2-6_ZERO","LMAOOOOO, IT'S THE DEFLI...MASKI (it's actually DEFLEMASK btw lololol)"
"VILE3-1_ZERO","Don't you ever get tired of the whole \""justice\"" thing?"
"VILE3-2_ZERO","Don't you ever get tired of being Sigma's simp?"
"VILE3-3_ZERO","Ooooh someone's toxic today. Full turn-down-for-what energy."
"VILE3-4_ZERO","But fr bro, why didn't you take the stairs? Would've been faster."
"VILE3-5_ZERO","Oh I see... You wanted to climb the whole mountain just with wall kicks. In other words, \""Road to the Top\"""
"VILE3-6_ZERO","Because I, Vile-Lucas-Gaming-MK5-pro-mega-man-player, shall become the greatest YouTuber of a-"
"VILE3-7_ZERO","Yeah yeah yeah we all know already, let's just fight, I'm in a hurry."
"VILE4-1_ZERO","Bro you are SO annoying holy crap."
"VILE4-2_ZERO","All this drama going on and you still can't order a beer and chill?"
"VILE4-3_ZERO","Drama?"
"VILE4-4_ZERO","I'm just tired of running into you and Sigma every time I turn around."
"VILE4-5_ZERO","Huh, what's this about turning around?"
"VILE4-6_ZERO","You want a massage or something? Let me take care of that for you fam."
"COPYSIGMA1_ZERO","Sigma.....! You scumbag!"
"COPYSIGMA2_ZERO","You betrayed humanity and killed my allies. I'll put an end to your rebellion!"
"COPYSIGMA3_ZERO","lmaooo long time no see Zero. U like this fire armor? Pretty sick right? lmaooo."
"COPYSIGMA4_ZERO","Stop ignoring me you coward! My fight is with you, here and now!"
"COPYSIGMA5_ZERO","This time you're going down FOR REAL! I WILL DEFEAT YOU SIGMA!"
"COPYSIGMA6_ZERO","Wonder who's gonna catch that reference tho. He he he he."
"COPYSIGMA7_ZERO","Bring it on Zoro! Let me show you the power of a fire cosplay bro."
"SIGMA1_ZERO","Ah, Zero... Zero, Zerino, Big Z, 1-800-ZERO and everything in between."
"SIGMA2_ZERO","You know, I think in the end, you guys were totally right."
"SIGMA3_ZERO","Being bald doesn't suit my style, so I decided to become the devil himself. Way cooler vibe for me."
"SIGMA4_ZERO","You look more like a simp with horns honestly."
"SIGMA5_ZERO","Shut up, my horns are well-crafted thank you very much."
"SIGMA6_ZERO","Unlike yours which look like bootleg party store spikes."
"SIGMA7_ZERO","At least I don't look like I got run over on the highway and used plasma gas to replace the body I don't have."
"SIGMA8_ZERO","BROYOUBETTERWATCH YOUR MOUTH OR I SWEAR TO GOD BRO I'M NOT AN NPC TO BE DISRESPECTED LIKE THIS"
"SIGMA9_ZERO","I'LLSHOWYOUWHATA REAL DEVIL LOOKS LIKE!"
"SIGMA10_ZERO","DIE ZERO, JUST DIE ZEROOOOOOO!!!!!"
"SIGMA11_ZERO","LMAOOO I FORGOT HOW TO LAUGH IN TEXT FORM TOO >:]"
"SIGMA12_ZERO","He's completely lost it. Time to end this horned clown once and for all!"
"FINALLUMINE1_ZERO","Lumine! The director of the Jakob Project. Are you okay?"
"FINALLUMINE2_ZERO","......."
"FINALLUMINE3_ZERO","Greetings, mere mortal. I see you have awakened me in this place."
"FINALLUMINE4_ZERO","If my calculations are correct, we are on the surface of the Moon, correct?"
"FINALLUMINE5_ZERO","W-who are you? You don't seem to be Lumine."
"FINALLUMINE6_ZERO","Lumine? Hah, of course I'm not."
"FINALLUMINE7_ZERO","Lumine does not inhabit this Reploid carcass of questionable gender."
"FINALLUMINE8_ZERO","Don't you remember me? It is I, the Star of the Moonlight."
"FINALLUMINE9_ZERO","Star of the Moonlight?\n! ! !\nWait, don't tell me you're the..."
"FINALLUMINE10_ZERO","Correct, small fry, and judging by your voice you must be Mint Abu Chan."
"FINALLUMINE11_ZERO","Didn't expect you to summon me here, hehe :3"
"FINALLUMINE12_ZERO","But wait, is it just you here? Where is the...."
"FINALLUMINE13_ZERO","I'm afraid if you're looking for [Kingdom Hearts protagonist + Yasakani Clan member], he's not available at the moment."
"FINALLUMINE14_ZERO","Who knows, maybe someday he'll show up too. Destiny can be tricky sometimes."
"FINALLUMINE15_ZERO","Now, you must be wondering. \""Why does she look like she's about to cause problems?\"""
"FINALLUMINE16_ZERO","Simple answer: you were foolish to summon me, and because of that, I am able to awaken my other form."
"FINALLUMINE17_ZERO","Chimamire no Ekuripusu."
"FINALLUMINE18_ZERO","Chimichanga no Egyptian?"
"FINALLUMINE19_ZERO","WHAT???? LMAOOOOO"
"FINALLUMINE20_ZERO","No you fool."
"FINALLUMINE21_ZERO","It's pronounced Chimamire no Ekuripusu."
"FINALLUMINE22_ZERO","(How dare this kid mispronounce my name, especially him who loves speaking in Hiragana and Katakana)."
"FINALLUMINE23_ZERO","Now you shall face the worst consequences."
"FINALLUMINE24_ZERO","Not only for mispronouncing my name, but for thinking I'm still the Star of the Moonlight."
"FINALLUMINE25_ZERO","Do you feel safe? Now that you know what entity you've just summoned?"
"FINALLUMINE26_ZERO","I..... I don't understand....."
"FINALLUMINE27_ZERO","Awww, look at you."
"FINALLUMINE28_ZERO","Mint Abu Chan. So small, so pacifist, so kind..... But also so naive."
"FINALLUMINE29_ZERO","You think you understand anything about me? You comprehend anything at all?"
"FINALLUMINE30_ZERO","No, of course not. If you lived in my universe, your hopes would have already been shattered."
"FINALLUMINE31_ZERO","What happened? Why the angry expression?"
"FINALLUMINE32_ZERO","You want to try to stop me? You? A mere mortal who proclaims himself a \""Guardian of the Earth\""?"
"FINALLUMINE33_ZERO","Ha ha ha ha ha ha! You're killing me, as if I even had a heart."
"FINALLUMINE34_ZERO","How about I just end your suffering by deleting you right here and now?"
"FINALLUMINE35_ZERO","And you think I'm just gonna obey you?! I may be kind but NOT that much of a pushover!"
"FINALLUMINE36_ZERO","You may not be the Star of the Moonlight I know, but I won't surrender my hope because of that!"
"FINALLUMINE37_ZERO","Do your worst! I fear neither you nor my own fears. If I summoned you then I'll banish you myself!"
"FINALLUMINE38_ZERO","Tch! I came here to take out all my rage on a bunch of mortals."
"FINALLUMINE39_ZERO","But now that I know you better, IT ONLY MAKES ME WANT TO DESTROY YOU MORE!!! >:("
"FINALLUMINE40_ZERO","The nature of your existence must perish at once. I will end you and annihilate your soul once and for all! DIE!!!!"
"FINALLUMINE41_ZERO","Talk all the trash you want, but I won't let you get away with this. LET'S GOOOOO!!!! EGYPTIAN!!!!!!!!!"
"SECRET2-1_ZERO","Welcome Zero, it's a pleasure to meet you for the first time."
"SECRET2-2_ZERO","Huh? Oh, thanks. You don't look like a Maverick like the others."
"SECRET2-3_ZERO","I can feel something... Peaceful in your presence, who are you?"
"SECRET2-4_ZERO","How observant of you to notice so quickly."
"SECRET2-5_ZERO","My name is NeeN. I mean, Serenade. (LMAOOOOO)"
"SECRET2-6_ZERO","You mentioned I'm different from others you faced before?"
"SECRET2-7_ZERO","That is because of my absolutely cracked power."
"SECRET2-8_ZERO","Cracked? Wait, CRACKED???????"
"SECRET2-9_ZERO","Correct. My strength isn't about aggression. I've been training since I lost the title of UnderKing."
"SECRET2-10_ZERO","Now that you mentioned my presence, I feel that you're somehow.... Familiar."
"SECRET2-11_ZERO","Hmm?"
"SECRET2-12_ZERO","Could be that.... You are the one destined to bring destruction to us?"
"SECRET2-13_ZERO","What? What do you know about me? Tell me right now!"
"SECRET2-14_ZERO","Why don't you fight me and find out?"
"SECRET2-15_ZERO","For twenty years, I've been grinding power. I choose you to test my build."
"SECRET2-16_ZERO","Serenade, right?"
"SECRET2-17_ZERO","Very well then, I accept your 1v1. Let's do it!"
"SECRET2-18_ZERO","So be it, let's go Zero! Show me your strength! And try not to rage too hard lol."
"SECRET2-19_ZERO","I truly believed my power would be enough to defeat you. It seems I was mistaken."
"SECRET2-20_ZERO","Now that I've observed your way of fighting better, you don't appear to be like \""him\""."
"SECRET2-21_ZERO","You share strong similarities, but you seem to know what you're fighting for."
"SECRET2-22_ZERO","Are you saying that there is a counterpart of me which is my opposite?"
"SECRET2-23_ZERO","Indeed, but I fear he will be defeated by \""a Needle Man fan on YouTube\"" just like me."
"SECRET2-24_ZERO","You fought beautifully, Zero. You truly were the strongest opponent I've encountered in this world."
"SECRET2-25_ZERO","I wish I had something more to offer as a reward... but all I can give is my gratitude. :^)"
"SECRET2-26_ZERO","Heh, no need to worry about it. Just the fact that you weren't a Maverick makes me feel rewarded."
"SECRET2-27_ZERO","Perhaps we'll meet again, in another place... until then, farewell, Zero."
"SECRET2-28_ZERO","And remember, think about what you are really fighting for."
"SECRET2-29_ZERO","AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
"SECRET3-1_ZERO","Y... You! Hey! You soft-handed clown!"
"SECRET3-2_ZERO","You talking to me?"
"SECRET3-3_ZERO","No sweetheart, I'm talking to your mom."
"SECRET3-4_ZERO","........ Oh good."
"SECRET3-5_ZERO","See you around then!"
"SECRET3-6_ZERO","Hold on a minute pal!"
"SECRET3-7_ZERO","Tch!"
"SECRET3-8_ZERO","Spit out what you want already!"
"SECRET3-9_ZERO","I bet your attitude is about as big as your mom's-"
"SECRET3-10_ZERO","Tch! Bro you messed up my makeup dude, what the actual hell."
"SECRET3-11_ZERO","I've done this to a famous band member before and HE didn't complain."
"SECRET3-12_ZERO","Plus Axl has a scar on his face too. So stop being a crybaby and accept it."
"SECRET3-13_ZERO","Ha ha ha... Thinking about it, having a sick scar on my face might not be so bad. Better follow his \""casual\"" advice."
"SECRET3-14_ZERO","Well then, that's that. See you around."
"SECRET3-15_ZERO","Wait but what about the X7 dema- ah forget it, let's just go."
"FINAL-6","Nope nope nope, you too X, all bruised and crying, ugh. Just get back to base already you idiots."
