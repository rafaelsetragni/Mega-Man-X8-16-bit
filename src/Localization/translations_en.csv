"INTRO2-1","This is X! I'm close to the site of the accident near the Orbital Elevator!"
"INTRO2-2","The place is crawling with Mavericks!"
"INTRO2-3","I'll make my way to the site. Get ready to send rescue mechaniloids on my signal!"
"INTRO2-4","Roger!"
"INTRO2-5","S-Sigma...!?"
"INTRO2-6","To protect ourselves from damage during the accident..."
"INTRO2-7","We had to copy a sturdy Sigma body."
"INTRO2-8","We New Generation Reploids enjoy complete and total immunity to all viruses."
"INTRO2-9","So even copying something as dangerous as Sigma provides no risk."
"INTRO2-10","Who are you?"
"INTRO2-11","I'm Lumine..."
"INTRO2-12","I'm the director in charge of the elevator and the Jakob Project."
"INTRO2-13","I see. Hold tight, I'll signal my team to send in the rescue-"
"INTRO3-1","How nice to see you again, X!"
"INTRO3-2","Vile?!"
"INTRO3-3","Ha ha ha... I'd love to stay and play with you, but I'm afraid I have too much work to do..."
"INTRO3-4","You're a wanted criminal! Stop and let Lumine go!"
"INTRO3-5","Not a chance. The Orbital Elevator is under our control now..."
"INTRO3-6","Just what do you plan to do?!"
"INTRO3-7","It begins now, X. A new world will be born!"
"INTRO3-8","Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"ANTONION1","Gravity Antonion... You used to be an incredible scientist. What happened?"
"ANTONION2","Incredible scientist? Who are you to say such things?"
"ANTONION3","I don't pursue my research just to earn praise from the likes of you."
"ANTONION4","Did he... Did Sigma make you go Maverick?"
"ANTONION5","Maverick? Once again, you attach labels to me. What arrogance!"
"ANTONION6","At any rate, if you choose to stand in my way, I'll destroy you!"
"MANOWAR1","Gigabolt Manowar!"
"MANOWAR2","Return Abel City's energy supply to normal! If you don't, the city will be destroyed!"
"MANOWAR3","... ... ..."
"MANOWAR4","...I'm not doing anything wrong... Who are you, anyway?"
"MANOWAR5","I'm Mega Man X. I'm a Maverick Hunter."
"MANOWAR6","Has Sigma made you go Maverick?"
"MANOWAR7","I'm no Maverick... I'm in complete control of myself and my actions..."
"MANOWAR8","I'm working hard to realize our dream of a new world...!"
"MANOWAR9","You've gone Maverick! I'll have to stop you!"
"MANTIS1","Hey! What's a Maverick Hunter doing here?"
"MANTIS2","Dark Mantis... You've gone Maverick. I'm putting an end to your weapons production."
"MANTIS3","We New Generation Reploids are designed so that we can't go Maverick, kid."
"MANTIS4","Then why are you making weapons? Is Sigma controlling you?"
"MANTIS5","And what exactly is controlling you, X? Your precious \""justice\""? Is that it?"
"MANTIS6","Dark Mantis... Your actions are those of a Maverick!"
"MANTIS7","Not surprisingly, you old style Reploids really don't understand a thing."
"MANTIS8","Let my blade show you how misguided your so called \""justice\"" really is!"
"PANDA1","Did you know that the earliest form of rocketry was missiles used for war?"
"PANDA2","All of history has been spent making things whose sole purpose is to destroy. Missiles... Reploids..."
"PANDA3","What are you talking about? No Reploid wishes for destruction."
"PANDA4","You mean to tell me you've never thought such things yourself, X?"
"PANDA5","That this world wishes for destruction and nothing more?"
"PANDA6","Is that what Sigma believes? But... That's..."
"PANDA7","I know what you are going to say."
"PANDA8","You think that idea to be Maverick, don't you?"
"PANDA9","That's why we are forced to fight, you see."
"ROOSTER1","Do you know what this place is, X?"
"ROOSTER2","It's the borderline waste disposal center. Where garbage is pressurized and burned..."
"ROOSTER3","Burn Rooster, why have you started a riot? Is Sigma controlling you?"
"ROOSTER4","This is no ordinary riot. This is revenge for all the Reploids you labeled Maverick and threw onto this scrap heap!"
"ROOSTER5","Mavericks bring only disaster and destruction! We have no choice but to stop them!"
"ROOSTER6","This is what you mean when you speak of justice? It's you who should be scrapped!"
"ROOSTER7","What does Sigma plan to do? You know, he's just using you. Nothing more!"
"ROOSTER8","Using me? If that's the price I have to pay to bring about the new world, so be it!"
"ROOSTER9","There's no place for Reploids like you in the new world we will create!"
"SUNFLOWER1","X... Since you made it this far, you must have figured it out."
"SUNFLOWER2","You must have an inkling as to what we're after here."
"SUNFLOWER3","You Mavericks... You're under Sigma's control, aren't you?"
"SUNFLOWER4","Sorry to disappoint, but no one can control us."
"SUNFLOWER5","We may not be the good guys, but we're no monsters."
"SUNFLOWER6","No one has the right to put a stop to our plans!"
"TRILOBYTE1","Do you realize that the ore we mine here is used in space development?"
"TRILOBYTE2","Sigma must be behind this! What does he want with these minerals?"
"TRILOBYTE3","Even if I explained, I doubt a brainless Maverick Hunter like yourself could understand."
"TRILOBYTE4","I'll bury you old heaps of junk right here!"
"YETI1","I will not let you get in our way."
"YETI2","Avalanche Yeti! What do you think you're doing?"
"YETI3","We no longer considers your world to be ideal. You old model Reploids have no business here."
"YETI4","Get out of here, X!"
"YETI5","No way! If we don't repair this system, the world's ecological balance is at risk!"
"YETI6","Hmph. It's too late, X. "
"YETI7","You and your puny Maverick Hunters have lost!"
"VILE1-1","Vile!"
"VILE1-2","Where have you taken Lumine? Do you plan to hinder the Jakob Project?"
"VILE1-3","Reunited after all this time apart, and all you do is bombard me with questions?"
"VILE1-4","Don't worry about our little friend. Lumine is being taken care of. Ha ha ha..."
"VILE1-5","The Orbital Elevator is too important to us to hurt the one who operates it."
"VILE1-6","Don't you know what you're doing?"
"VILE1-7","The Jakob Project is an important joint venture between humans and reploids!"
"VILE1-8","Chill out, X..."
"VILE1-9","Let's enjoy this little reunion, OK?"
"VILE2-1","Vile!"
"VILE2-2","I'm through chasing you down. Let Lumine go. Now!"
"VILE2-3","Ha ha ha... Lumine? Always the positive thinker, aren't you?"
"VILE2-4","Look around you, fool! Your world has already begun to crumble! Are you so dim as to think you're in a position to make demands?"
"VILE2-5","The world as you know it? Mavericks? Kiss it all goodbye!"
"VILE2-6","Mayhem, doom and destruction! That's what we were built for!"
"VILE3-1","Ha ha ha! You're struggling awful hard for a world that's doomed!"
"VILE3-2","So, it was Sigma pulling the strings the whole time, wasn't it, Vile?"
"VILE3-3","Ha ha ha... Are you starting to finally piece it together, X? "
"VILE3-4","The Orbital Elevator... the energy... the space minerals... the rocket data..."
"VILE3-5","The route to space... the thing that's allowed this world to survive this long... is ours!"
"VILE3-6","At times like this, how important is your precious term \""Maverick\""?"
"VILE3-7","I don't care what you plan to do. I'll put a stop to it no matter what!"
"VILE4-1","So, you still refuse to give up your struggle, eh?"
"VILE4-2","Are you so blind that you've somehow convinced yourself that hope remains?"
"VILE4-3","As long as I'm standing, there's hope!"
"VILE4-4","I'll defeat both you and Sigma!"
"VILE4-5","Ha ha ha... I suppose it'd be a waste to just destroy you now..."
"VILE4-6","Maybe I'll wait till the last possible moment and have a little fun with this!"
"COPYSIGMA1","Sigma!?"
"COPYSIGMA2","I shall allow you to call me by that name, for I am indeed Sigma."
"COPYSIGMA3","You plan to take revenge on every Reploid... Every human... In the entire world?"
"COPYSIGMA4","You're completely mad! I'm putting a stop to this right now!"
"COPYSIGMA5","Put a stop to what? We already control the moon."
"COPYSIGMA6","That old world has decayed and rotted. We will usher in a new world to replace it!"
"COPYSIGMA7","But, before that, X, perhaps it's time for our final showdown!"
"SIGMA1","Welcome, Maverick Hunter. It's good to see you again, X."
"SIGMA2","Our meeting was fated, X. Our destinies come to a head right here, right now."
"SIGMA3","The time has come to usher in a new age. And your destruction, X, is an essential part of it."
"SIGMA4","..."
"SIGMA5","Your dedication to what you refer to as \""justice\"" is what first got me thinking..."
"SIGMA6","I realized the imperfection of this world, and decided I must change it."
"SIGMA7","Don't blame me for your insanity, Sigma!"
"SIGMA8","Ha ha ha... it's too late, X. The gears are in motion. There's no turning back now."
"SIGMA9","The New Generation Reploids were the ones, X. My children are responsible for all of this..."
"SIGMA10","Children? What are you talking about!?"
"SIGMA11","The Jakob Project... The program that gave birth to the New Generation Reploids... It only happened because of me!"
"SIGMA12","Wallow in despair and hopelessness! You are powerless in the face of the ruler of the new world!"
"SIGMA13","Now, X... You will be destroyed along with the rest of this decayed world!"
"FINALLUMINE1","Oh, Lumine! Are you OK?"
"FINALLUMINE2","Am I OK...? Of course."
"FINALLUMINE3","Now that you've defeated Sigma, I supose you're satisfied."
"FINALLUMINE4","But you see, he merely helped my plan along..."
"FINALLUMINE5","The New Generation Reploids have been awakened and the new world is at hand!"
"FINALLUMINE6","Lumine! What are you doing!?"
"FINALLUMINE7","Don't tell me you've gone Maverick, too..."
"FINALLUMINE8","Maverick? You know that's not the case, X."
"FINALLUMINE9","That's why you are hesitating. You don't have it in you..."
"FINALLUMINE10","...!"
"FINALLUMINE11","Old models like you have to worry if your actions are truly your own."
"FINALLUMINE12","Who knows what might be influencing you at this very moment?"
"FINALLUMINE13","However, we New Generation Reploids were built using data derived from hundreds of old model Repolids. "
"FINALLUMINE14","That's what grants us total immunity to all viruses. We can act how we choose, as it guarantees our own free will!"
"FINALLUMINE15","And that might include acting as Sigma once did before us... Do you understand what I'm getting at here?"
"FINALLUMINE16","No Reploid would choose to be insane like Sigma!"
"FINALLUMINE17","Think about it, X... Was Sigma really crazy?"
"FINALLUMINE18","..."
"FINALLUMINE19","Yes, he rebelled against your world. Perhaps due to a virus."
"FINALLUMINE20","Even so, his struggle showed all of us how this world is rotten!"
"FINALLUMINE21","Humans using Reploids to perpetuate their accursed cycle of aggression..."
"FINALLUMINE22","That's why our decision to wage battle against the old world was made consciously."
"FINALLUMINE23","In other words..."
"FINALLUMINE24","We possess the power to go Maverick at will!"
"FINALLUMINE25","...!"
"FINALLUMINE26","X... Do you really have what it takes to stop us?"
"FINALLUMINE27","You're merely a tool of the humans. Nothing but a tool of the old world..."
"FINALLUMINE28","And you think you can stand up to those of us who have evolved this far?"
"FINALLUMINE29","Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Don't make me laugh..."
"FINALLUMINE30","The world is changing! It's only natural that evolution take it's course!"
"FINALLUMINE31","Now, line up to be exterminated!"
"FINALLUMINE32","Lumine... I'm sorry but... I don't have other choice."
"FINALLUMINE33","Even if you were behind the Jakob Project..."
"FINALLUMINE34","I won't give up until I've put a stop to your evil scheme!"
"FINALLUMINE35","You had everything to be our ally, but in the end you became our enemy."
"FINALLUMINE36","And I won't let you get away with this!"
"FINALLUMINE37","Enemy... Ally... This issue isn't so black and white."
"FINALLUMINE38","Reploids, along with humanity, have irrevocably changed."
"FINALLUMINE39","The nature of their existence has also changed..."
"FINALLUMINE40","And you are not needed in our new world!"
"ENDING1-1","ENDING1-1"
"ENDING1-2","Unbelievable..."
"ENDING1-3","You may have defeated me... But it's too late to stop what's already begun..."
"ENDING1-4","I'll take on plenty more like you, if that's what it takes."
"ENDING1-5","Ha ha ha... You really don't have a grasp of the situation, do you?"
"ENDING1-6","Oh well... You'll find out... soon enough..."
"ENDING1-7","....."
"ENDING1-8","Ugh! I can’t stand this pain anymore... Just... Make it quick..."
"ENDING2-1","This is X..."
"ENDING2-2","The enemy... Has been dealt with."
"ENDING2-3","I'm headed back now..."
"ENDING2-4","Roger..."
"FINAL-1","Axl!"
"FINAL-2","X... X... Can you hear me? Communication has been restored. Status report!"
"FINAL-3","This is X, we've managed to stop Sigma's plans... But Axl..."
"FINAL-4","Axl has been injured, but he's fine."
"FINAL-5","We're heading back now."
"FINAL2-1","(Awakening...)"
"FINAL2-2","(That's how Lumine described it...)"
"FINAL2-3","(He said... this was evolution...)"
"FINAL2-4","(If he's right...)"
"FINAL2-5","(Then... What are we doing?)"
"FINAL3-1","I bet you've been thinking about what Lumine was saying a while ago."
"FINAL3-2","Well don't let it get to you. Just becoming Sigma could hardly be called evolution."
"FINAL3-3","..."
"FINAL3-4","Anyway. X..."
"FINAL3-5","Even if we Reploids are destined to join the scrap heap when that \""evolutionary step\"" does come about..."
"FINAL3-6","We still have to fight..."
"FINAL3-7","Not only against Mavericks, but against our own destiny as well..."
"SECRET2-1","Welcome, Mega Man X. I've been waiting for you."
"SECRET2-2","You are different from anyone I've faced before..."
"SECRET2-3","You exude an aura of peace and mercy. Who are you?"
"SECRET2-4","How keen of you to notice this so soon."
"SECRET2-5","I am Serenade."
"SECRET2-6","You mentioned I'm different from others you faced before?"
"SECRET2-7","That is because of my overwhelming power."
"SECRET2-8","Overwhelming...?"
"SECRET2-9","Correct. I've been training to be stronger ever since I lost the title of UnderKing."
"SECRET2-10","For twenty years I've been amassing power. Now I've choosen you to test my strength against."
"SECRET2-11","Serenade, was it? Hmm..."
"SECRET2-12","Okay, I accept your duel!"
"SECRET2-13","Then, come to me..."
"SECRET2-14","I honestly thought I was strong enough to defeat you. I was wrong."
"SECRET2-15","The kindness, love and respect that you possess in your heart makes you even more powerful."
"SECRET2-16","You fought this duel beautifully. You really are the strongest robot in this world."
"SECRET2-17","I wish I had something to reward you. The best I can offer you are my thanks."
"SECRET2-18","Mega Man X. We shall meet again, in some other place..."
"SECRET2-19","For now, farewell!"
"SECRET3-1","Finally, I've acquired it. This data contains information on all currently wanted criminals..."
"SECRET3-2","You, freeze. This area is restricted to S Class Hunters, as is that data! Hand it over and come quietly!"
"SECRET3-3","I know how this looks like, but fret not, X."
"SECRET3-4","My name is Red. I've learned that you have been struggling with these recent events, so I decided to... help. "
"SECRET3-5","With this, we'll be able to start our own Maverick hunting and take some load off your shoulders... For a price, of course."
"SECRET3-6","Sounds more like you're a filthy bounty hunter."
"SECRET3-7","You are free to think whatever you want. I'm not backing down... Get Ready!"
"SECRET3-8","Not bad... for an old timer..."
"ZEROSECRET1","He he he he he!"
"ZEROSECRET2","Finally, I understand the means now, I've never been so happy..."
"ZEROSECRET3","Z... Zero?"
"ZEROSECRET4","X! My mind is becoming very clear... Now I understand my real purpose."
"ZEROSECRET5","I don't care about the Mavericks anymore... All I have to do now is one thing..."
"ZEROSECRET6","Zero? What happened to you? This is not you. Snap out of it! You'll die if you keep this up!"
"ZEROSECRET7","I finally feel free from my chains, X. After all this time being Fragile, Weak, Powerless..."
"ZEROSECRET8","I finally Awakened my true form! LOOK INTO MY EYES X! CAN'T YOU FEEL MY HAPPINESS?! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!"
"ZEROSECRET9","..."
"ZEROSECRET10","Zero... This is what you told me before, right?"
"ZEROSECRET11","There are things that cannot be seen or analyzed."
"ZEROSECRET12","We have to feel it..."
"ZEROSECRET13","And now... I can feel, feel something strongly evil... more evil than Sigma!"
"ZEROSECRET14","This is our destiny, isn't it? I will fight! I won't run away! I'll defeat you and bring my friend back!"
"ZEROSECRET15","Then I don't need to explain anymore things to you now. I'LL DESTROY YOU!"
"ZEROSECRET16","ZERO!!!!"
"INTRO2-1_AXL","Hey Alia, It's Axl! I'm close to the site of the accident near the Orbital Elevator!"
"INTRO2-2_AXL","Damn, it's a total mess out here, Mavericks are around everywhere!"
"INTRO2-3_AXL","I'm on my way in! Get those rescue mechaniloids ready to roll as soon as I give the word!"
"INTRO2-4_AXL","Got it, Axl! Be careful!"
"INTRO2-5_AXL","S-Sigma?! But... how?!"
"INTRO2-6_AXL","To protect ourselves from damage during the accident..."
"INTRO2-7_AXL","We had to copy a sturdy Sigma body."
"INTRO2-8_AXL","We New Generation Reploids enjoy complete and total immunity to all viruses."
"INTRO2-9_AXL","So even copying something as dangerous as Sigma provides no risk."
"INTRO2-10_AXL","Wait, who are you?"
"INTRO2-11_AXL","I'm Lumine..."
"INTRO2-12_AXL","I'm the director in charge of the elevator and the Jakob Project."
"INTRO2-13_AXL","Got it. Hang tight, I'll signal my team to send in the rescue-"
"INTRO3-1_AXL","Well, well... Who do we have here? A little rookie?"
"INTRO3-2_AXL","What the heck?! Who are you?"
"INTRO3-3_AXL","I'm Vile. I'd say it's nice to meet you, but that'd be a lie."
"INTRO3-4_AXL","Where's your little buddy X?"
"INTRO3-5_AXL","X? What's your deal with him?"
"INTRO3-6_AXL","Ha ha ha! Nothing much... Just looking to take care of some unfinished business."
"INTRO3-7_AXL","You're not taking anyone down! Let Lumine go!"
"INTRO3-8_AXL","Not a chance. The Orbital Elevator is under our control now..."
"INTRO3-9_AXL","What are you planning to do?!"
"INTRO3-10_AXL","It begins now, kid... A new world will be born!"
"INTRO3-11_AXL","Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"ANTONION1_AXL","Antonion... You used to be such a genius. Have you gone insane? What are you planning?"
"ANTONION2_AXL","Insane? Ha ha. That's funny."
"ANTONION3_AXL","Are you saying that you yourself are perfectly sane? Are you even sure you're on the right side?"
"ANTONION4_AXL","I'm pretty sure. It's not too hard to tell good from evil. That much I know for sure."
"ANTONION5_AXL","Ha! I couldn't agree more!"
"ANTONION6_AXL","The problem here is the world we live in. But I plan to fix all that!"
"MANOWAR1_AXL","What's going on here, Man-o-War?"
"MANOWAR2_AXL","If you don't return the power to normal, the people of Abel City will suffer."
"MANOWAR3_AXL","... ... ..."
"MANOWAR4_AXL","He's so far gone becoming Maverick, he can't even talk..."
"MANOWAR5_AXL","What? What's a Maverick? Do you know what it is?"
"MANOWAR6_AXL","Maverick? That's an out of control Reploid like yourself."
"MANOWAR7_AXL","Sorry pal, but I'll have to take you down."
"MANTIS1_AXL","I hear you're a prototype of us New Generation Reploids."
"MANTIS2_AXL","So, why did you become a Maverick Hunter?"
"MANTIS3_AXL","Because I enjoy mopping the floor with the likes of evil Mavericks like you, Mantis."
"MANTIS4_AXL","Hmph. How dare you accuse me of being something that I cannot be?"
"MANTIS5_AXL","There is no such thing as good and evil. You haven't realized that yet, have you?"
"MANTIS6_AXL","I may be a prototype, but don't assume I'm anything like you Maverick creeps!"
"MANTIS7_AXL","You're awfully innocent for a prototype of us new Reploids."
"MANTIS8_AXL","I'll admit I'm a bit jealous."
"MANTIS9_AXL","How about I demonstrate to you with my Blades?"
"PANDA1_AXL","You have the same copy ability that we New Generation Reploids enjoy."
"PANDA2_AXL","..."
"PANDA3_AXL","Have you ever thought that power could change the world?"
"PANDA4_AXL","The only thing I think is how it comes in handy in whipping you Mavericks!"
"PANDA5_AXL","Such petulance. I suppose we have no use for you after all."
"ROOSTER1_AXL","Know where you are, chum?"
"ROOSTER2_AXL","The name's Axl, and I'm no chum of yours."
"ROOSTER3_AXL","Anyway, this is the waste disposal center..."
"ROOSTER4_AXL","It's so much more than that."
"ROOSTER5_AXL","It's the graveyard of all the Reploids deemed Maverick."
"ROOSTER6_AXL","Oh, so you thought you'd just start an uprising in return?"
"ROOSTER7_AXL","That's Maverick behavior."
"ROOSTER8_AXL","This is what you mean when you speak of justice? It's you who should be scrapped!"
"ROOSTER9_AXL","There's no place for Reploids and old models like you in the new world we will create!"
"SUNFLOWER1_AXL","Axl... The shape-shifter. The prototype of the Reploids who will lead the new age..."
"SUNFLOWER2_AXL","So what? You sayin' I should join you? Tough luck, chump!"
"SUNFLOWER3_AXL","If only you were a little smarter, you could have been chosen too..."
"SUNFLOWER4_AXL","That's where you're wrong. We may not be the good guys, but we're no monsters."
"SUNFLOWER5_AXL","Such concepts are beyond the grasp of halfwits like you."
"SUNFLOWER6_AXL","This guy is out of control, better take him down before he continues with his nonsense."
"TRILOBYTE1_AXL","The minerals we mine here are essential to the development of space."
"TRILOBYTE2_AXL","I don't suppose a half-baked prototype like you could guess what I'm getting at."
"TRILOBYTE3_AXL","You Mavericks never made a lick of sense to me."
"TRILOBYTE4_AXL","I've been chosen and you've been left behind. You'll never be as brilliant as me!"
"TRILOBYTE5_AXL","You're the one with poor judgment, Trilobyte. Getting fooled and used by Sigma!"
"TRILOBYTE6_AXL","Our brand new world will soon be born! Fools like you from the old world will fall!"
"YETI1_AXL","So you are the prototype who can shape-shift?"
"YETI2_AXL","If we turn Maverick this easily, I can't say I'm happy to be your prototype."
"YETI3_AXL","Strong words for someone as lowly as a Maverick Hunter."
"YETI4_AXL","Who you callin' low? You're trying to destroy the world, not me!"
"VILE1-1_AXL","Ha ha ha ha ha!"
"VILE1-2_AXL","Why don't you just give up now and get it over with?"
"VILE1-3_AXL","The world as you know it? Mavericks? Kiss it all goodbye!"
"VILE1-4_AXL","Mayhem, doom, and destruction! That's what we were built for!"
"VILE1-5_AXL","Hmph, whatever, don't think you're going to avoid getting beaten just because you said that."
"VILE2-1_AXL","Vile, was it?"
"VILE2-2_AXL","What are you up to here?"
"VILE2-3_AXL","What do you plan to do with Lumine and the Elevator?"
"VILE2-4_AXL","Don't worry about Lumine. Unlike you, he holds some importance to our plan."
"VILE2-5_AXL","I don't care if you were once a Class A Hunter..."
"VILE2-6_AXL","You're Maverick now, and I know just how to deal with scum like you!"
"VILE2-7_AXL","Ha ha! Did I make you mad? Bring it on!"
"VILE3-1_AXL","Ha! You're still concerned with justice when the world is on the verge of destruction?"
"VILE3-2_AXL","You've got it, buddy!"
"VILE3-3_AXL","Thought I'd dispense a little justice your way before I go after Sigma!"
"VILE3-4_AXL","The Orbital Elevator... the energy... the space minerals... the rocket data..."
"VILE3-5_AXL","The route to space..."
"VILE3-6_AXL","The thing that's allowed this world to survive this long - is ours!"
"VILE3-7_AXL","At times like this, how important is your precious term \""Maverick\""?"
"VILE3-8_AXL","I'll tell you as soon as I'm done turning you into scrap!"
"VILE4-1_AXL","So, you still refuse to give up your struggle, eh?"
"VILE4-2_AXL","Are you so blind that you've somehow convinced yourself that hope remains?"
"VILE4-3_AXL","If all I have to do is defeat you, then I'm full of hope, buster."
"VILE4-4_AXL","If I give up now, all my efforts would be wasted. I refuse to give up!"
"VILE4-5_AXL","Ha ha ha... I suppose it'd be a waste to just destroy you now..."
"COPYSIGMA1_AXL","Sigma!?"
"COPYSIGMA2_AXL","Did you think you could keep us away by running and hiding in space like a coward?"
"COPYSIGMA3_AXL","Run? Hide? You're mistaken."
"COPYSIGMA4_AXL","We merely chose to leave that ignorant planet behind."
"COPYSIGMA5_AXL","Whatever you say. Either way, I'm gonna toast you right now!"
"COPYSIGMA6_AXL","Which one of us will be \""toasted\""? Let us see... You are not one of the chosen."
"COPYSIGMA7_AXL","Only we new Reploids may live in this new world! I've no use for flimsy prototypes!"
"SIGMA1_AXL","Hmph. So you must be the one they call Axl.."
"SIGMA2_AXL","The Prototype of the New Generation Reploids."
"SIGMA3_AXL","I'm surprised you've made it this far."
"SIGMA4_AXL","Hey... Stop calling me a prototype..."
"SIGMA5_AXL","I'm me... And you... You're a Maverick."
"SIGMA6_AXL","You are a puny and weak prototype! Nothing more!"
"SIGMA7_AXL","Your copy ability is far from developed. That's why you were left out."
"SIGMA8_AXL","The Mavericks are one club I'd prefer to be left out of!"
"SIGMA9_AXL","Only the pure New Generation Reploids... my children, are worthy!"
"SIGMA10_AXL","Your children?"
"SIGMA11_AXL","Yes, prototype... My children..."
"SIGMA12_AXL","The New Generation Reploids born of the Jakob Project all bear copy chips containing my personal data."
"SIGMA13_AXL","And now, the final phase of that project begins! "
"SIGMA14_AXL","You shall be destroyed!!!"
"FINALLUMINE1_AXL","Oh, Lumine. Are you OK?"
"FINALLUMINE2_AXL","Am I OK...? Of course."
"FINALLUMINE3_AXL","Now that you've defeated Sigma, I suppose you're satisfied."
"FINALLUMINE4_AXL","Thanks to you, the plan has gone smoothly."
"FINALLUMINE5_AXL","But... Lumine, weren't you just used by Sigma?"
"FINALLUMINE6_AXL","Used? I don't think so."
"FINALLUMINE7_AXL","You see, he merely helped my plan along."
"FINALLUMINE8_AXL","The New Generation Reploids have been awakened, and the new world is at hand!"
"FINALLUMINE9_AXL","Lumine! What are you doing? Don't tell me you've gone Maverick, too..."
"FINALLUMINE10_AXL","Maverick? You don't really think that's the case, do you?"
"FINALLUMINE11_AXL",".........!"
"FINALLUMINE12_AXL","The copy chips we New Generation Reploids possess..."
"FINALLUMINE13_AXL","They were derived from data from hundreds of old model Reploids."
"FINALLUMINE14_AXL","That means, of course, that Sigma was also included in the mix."
"FINALLUMINE15_AXL","Do you understand what I'm getting at here?"
"FINALLUMINE16_AXL","Copy chip? Sigma? Does that means that I'll go nuts like he did?"
"FINALLUMINE17_AXL","Sorry, but prototypes like you don't have the specs to cause something like that."
"FINALLUMINE18_AXL","Besides, was Sigma really crazy?"
"FINALLUMINE19_AXL",".........?"
"FINALLUMINE20_AXL","He rebelled against your world. But he had his reasons..."
"FINALLUMINE21_AXL","The rest of us New Generation Reploids could turn like that at any moment..."
"FINALLUMINE22_AXL","This decision to wage battle against the old world was made consciously."
"FINALLUMINE23_AXL","In other words, we possess the power to go Maverick at will!"
"FINALLUMINE24_AXL","Axl... Do you really have what it takes to stop us?"
"FINALLUMINE25_AXL","You're merely a tool of the humans. Nothing but a tool of the old world..."
"FINALLUMINE26_AXL","You think you can stand up in front of us with your weapon to those who have evolved this far?"
"FINALLUMINE27_AXL","Ha ha ha ha ha! Don't try to be ridiculous!"
"FINALLUMINE28_AXL","The world is changing. Therefore, it's only natural that evolution take it's course!"
"FINALLUMINE29_AXL","Now, line up to be exterminated!"
"FINALLUMINE30_AXL","I won't let you come to me and tell me what I am or what I should be."
"FINALLUMINE31_AXL","You are the enemy here and I will not allow you to leave here alive!"
"FINALLUMINE32_AXL","Enemy... Ally... This issue isn't so black and white. Reploids, along with humanity, have irrevocably changed."
"FINALLUMINE33_AXL","The nature of their existence has also changed. You are not needed in our new world!"
"ENDING1-1_AXL","Unbelievable..."
"ENDING1-2_AXL","You may have defeated me... But it's too late to stop what's already begun..."
"ENDING1-3_AXL","I'll take on plenty more like you, if that's what it takes."
"ENDING1-4_AXL","Ha ha ha... You really don't have a grasp of the situation, do you?"
"ENDING1-5_AXL","Oh well... You'll find out... soon enough..."
"ENDING1-6_AXL","....."
"ENDING1-7_AXL","Ugh! I can't stand this pain anymore... Just... Make it quick..."
"ENDING2-1_AXL","This is Axl..."
"ENDING2-2_AXL","Axl... Axl... Status report!"
"ENDING2-3_AXL","The mission....was accomplished"
"ENDING2-4_AXL","The enemy... Has been dealt with. I'm headed back now..."
"ENDING2-5_AXL","Roger..."
"SECRET2-1_AXL","Welcome, Axl. I've been expecting you."
"SECRET2-2_AXL","Oh, so you already know me, huh?"
"SECRET2-3_AXL","Gotta say, you're way more... \""Chill\"", than anyone I've faced before. What's your deal?"
"SECRET2-4_AXL","How observant of you to notice so quickly."
"SECRET2-5_AXL","I am Serenade."
"SECRET2-6_AXL","You mentioned I'm different from others you faced before?"
"SECRET2-7_AXL","That is because of my overwhelming power."
"SECRET2-8_AXL","Overwhelming power? Are you serious? You don't exactly look that part to be honest..."
"SECRET2-9_AXL","Correct. My strength isn't about aggression. I've been training ever since I lost the title of UnderKing."
"SECRET2-10_AXL","For twenty years, I've amassed power and refined my abilities. And now, I've chosen you to test them."
"SECRET2-11_AXL","Twenty years? Wow, that's a.... very long time. But hey, I've got this copy ability thing still going on."
"SECRET2-12_AXL","Serenade, was it? Hmm..."
"SECRET2-13_AXL","You sure you wanna take me on? You might be biting off more than you can chew. But hey, a challenge is a challenge. You're on!"
"SECRET2-14_AXL","Then step forward... Axl. Show me what you got!"
"SECRET2-15_AXL","I truly believed my power would be enough to defeat you. It seems I was mistaken."
"SECRET2-16_AXL","But you... You don't rely just on strength alone. There's something in your spirit that makes you stronger."
"SECRET2-17_AXL","It's more than mere combat skills. It's your tenacity, your heart..."
"SECRET2-18_AXL","Yeah, well... I've got a habit of surprising people. Guess I'm full of tricks like that."
"SECRET2-19_AXL","But you were no pushover either. I can respect that."
"SECRET2-20_AXL","You fought beautifully, Axl. You may be the strongest warrior I've encountered in this world."
"SECRET2-21_AXL","I wish I had something more to offer as a reward... but all I can give is my gratitude."
"SECRET2-22_AXL","Heh, don't sweat it. It was a good fight. That's all the reward I need..."
"SECRET2-23_AXL","Though, if you've got any other secret power-ups lying around, I wouldn't say no."
"SECRET2-24_AXL","Perhaps we'll meet again, in another place... until then, farewell, Axl."
"SECRET2-25_AXL","See ya, Serenade. Next time, I won't go so easy on you!"
"SECRET2-26_AXL","SECRET2-26_AXL"
"SECRET3-1_AXL","Finally, I've acquired it. This data contains information on all currently wanted criminals..."
"SECRET3-2_AXL","R.... Red? But... how?"
"SECRET3-3_AXL","Axl, it's been a while. How is your progress going on your own?"
"SECRET3-4_AXL","Red, wait! You're not supposed to be here. This area is only for High Ranked Hunters!"
"SECRET3-5_AXL","You're not the same, Red. Are you still following \""his\"" ways?"
"SECRET3-6_AXL","You've turned Red Alert into something twisted because of that!"
"SECRET3-7_AXL","I know how this looks like, but fret not. With this data, we can hunt Mavericks more effectively than the Hunters ever could."
"SECRET3-8_AXL","The Red Alert can return to have their justice back, Axl."
"SECRET3-9_AXL","That's not justice... It's power! And I'm not letting you to abuse it!"
"SECRET3-10_AXL","Heh, I never thought I would have to hear this kind of thinking from you. Well, let's see if you have improved. No Holding Back!"
"SECRET3-11_AXL","Not bad..... Kid, you've grown up as a Hunter."
"SECRET3-12_AXL","You don't have to do this, Red. It's not too late to start over, you can still be yourself if you join us."
"SECRET3-13_AXL","Maybe..... maybe not. Don't worry about me, I'll still go on my own way."
"SECRET3-14_AXL","But for now, I will be careful when trusting."
"SECRET3-15_AXL","Next time, Axl... it won't be this easy when we met again. Farewell.... and take care of yourself, boy."
"SECRET3-16_AXL","Red...."
"INTRO1-1_ZERO","So this is Noah's Park, huh? Not a bad place after all."
"INTRO1-2_ZERO","Zero, do you copy? There's a huge Maverick Mechaniloid in this area."
"INTRO1-3_ZERO","And it's close to the site of the accident near the Orbital Elevator. Got it!"
"INTRO1-4_ZERO","I'll clean up the Mavericks in this area."
"INTRO1-5_ZERO","Send the rescue Mechaniloids as soon as I get to the accident scene."
"INTRO1-6_ZERO","Understood, be careful, Zero!"
"INTRO2-1_ZERO","W... What? What's the meaning of this, Sigma?"
"INTRO2-2_ZERO","To protect ourselves from damage during the accident..."
"INTRO2-3_ZERO","We had to copy a sturdy Sigma body."
"INTRO2-4_ZERO","We New Generation Reploids enjoy complete and total immunity to all viruses."
"INTRO2-5_ZERO","So even copying something as dangerous as Sigma provides no risk."
"INTRO2-6_ZERO","Who are you? Identify yourself!"
"INTRO2-7_ZERO","I'm Lumine..."
"INTRO2-8_ZERO","I'm the director in charge of the elevator and the Jakob Project."
"INTRO2-9_ZERO","Hmmm... I see. Don't move, I'll call the rescue team to take you-"
"INTRO3-1_ZERO","Ha ha ha! How nice to see you again, Zero."
"INTRO3-2_ZERO","Vile? So they weren't lying when they reported your presence around again."
"INTRO3-3_ZERO","I'd love to stay and play with you, but I'm afraid I have too much work to do..."
"INTRO3-4_ZERO","I won't let a wanted criminal like you take Lumine away. Let him go now!"
"INTRO3-5_ZERO","Not a chance. The Orbital Elevator is under our control now..."
"INTRO3-6_ZERO","What do you plan to do, Maverick Scum?!"
"INTRO3-7_ZERO","It begins now, Zero. A new world will be born!"
"INTRO3-8_ZERO","Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"ANTONION1_ZERO","Gravity Antonion. You used to be an incredible scientist, but it looks like you've gone Maverick now."
"ANTONION2_ZERO","Incredible? Maverick? What do those words even mean?"
"ANTONION3_ZERO","You'd have to ask someone smarter than me. Has Sigma made you like this?"
"ANTONION4_ZERO","Did he force you and the others to go Maverick?"
"ANTONION5_ZERO","You actually think you can sum my master up with that word?"
"ANTONION6_ZERO","Our honesty is matched only by your supreme foolishness."
"ANTONION7_ZERO","Well, at any rate, If you can't understand our great plan, then I'll destroy you!"
"MANOWAR1_ZERO","Hey! Gigabolt Man-O-War!"
"MANOWAR2_ZERO","Return Abel City's power to normal. Now!"
"MANOWAR3_ZERO","... ... ..."
"MANOWAR4_ZERO","He's so far gone, he can't even respond..."
"MANOWAR5_ZERO","I'm no Maverick... I'm not doing anything wrong..."
"MANOWAR6_ZERO","My master needs energy to make his new world a reality."
"MANOWAR7_ZERO","Turning Abel City's power out of control? How does this fit into Sigma's evil plan?"
"MANOWAR8_ZERO","I'm just working hard to realize my master's dream of a new world. He's not wrong here."
"MANOWAR9_ZERO","A new world?! Well, that plan's not getting any farther than this!"
"MANOWAR10_ZERO","Looks like I'll have to teach you a lesson!"
"MANTIS1_ZERO","Whoa. Get a load of this guy. You're Zero, right?"
"MANTIS2_ZERO","If you really knew me, you'd be shaking in your boots right about now."
"MANTIS3_ZERO","You old style Reploids really don't understand a thing, do you?"
"MANTIS4_ZERO","What do you mean by that, Maverick?"
"MANTIS5_ZERO","You could have made a great general in our ranks. My master has shown quite an interest in you, you know."
"MANTIS6_ZERO","Hmph! I'm not interested in joining up with Mavericks, thank you very much."
"MANTIS7_ZERO","And don't worry... I'll be going after your boss as soon as I'm finished with you."
"PANDA1_ZERO","You mean to tell me you've never thought such things yourself, Zero?"
"PANDA2_ZERO","That the world wishes for destruction and nothing more?"
"PANDA3_ZERO","Is that what Sigma tells you?"
"PANDA4_ZERO","Perhaps. Perhaps my master has also seen a little of himself inside of you..."
"PANDA5_ZERO","Gimme a break..."
"PANDA6_ZERO","This perfect world you Mavericks keep blabbering about doesn't even exist."
"PANDA7_ZERO","No, it doesn't."
"PANDA8_ZERO","That's why we must destroy this one."
"PANDA9_ZERO","What will end Zero, is this world."
"ROOSTER1_ZERO","Why have you started a riot? Is this Sigma's doing?"
"ROOSTER2_ZERO","Do you know what this place is?"
"ROOSTER3_ZERO","The waste disposal center..."
"ROOSTER4_ZERO","After I'm through slicing and dicing, this is where I'll toss what's left of you."
"ROOSTER5_ZERO","Can't you hear them, Zero?"
"ROOSTER6_ZERO","The cries of all the Reploids you've sent here because you decided they were Mavericks?"
"ROOSTER7_ZERO","Woah? Give me a break! If you can hear all that, I guess that means you're a Maverick too, huh?"
"ROOSTER8_ZERO","Ha! You'll realize soon enough who's right and who's wrong in this struggle."
"ROOSTER9_ZERO","You won't mock me when the new world becomes a reality!"
"SUNFLOWER1_ZERO","Zero... Surely you've figured it out."
"SUNFLOWER2_ZERO","You must have an inkling as to what we're after here."
"SUNFLOWER3_ZERO","What would I know about how you Mavericks think?"
"SUNFLOWER4_ZERO","No! No! No! We may not be the good guys, but we're no monsters."
"SUNFLOWER5_ZERO","My master remembers you well. You had the chance to become the ultimate destroyer. That's ancient history now."
"SUNFLOWER6_ZERO","Aw man... He's gone off the deep end."
"TRILOBYTE1_ZERO","The minerals we mine here are essential to the development of space."
"TRILOBYTE2_ZERO","But I don't suppose that means too much to you, does it Zero?"
"TRILOBYTE3_ZERO","And you're mining it for Sigma? Are you crazy?"
"TRILOBYTE4_ZERO","Have you given any thought as to why my master might want resources such as this?"
"TRILOBYTE5_ZERO","I don't need to understand your plan to know that it stinks, and I won't let you get away with it!"
"TRILOBYTE6_ZERO","Hmph! I will not be insulted by a broken down scrap heap like you!"
"TRILOBYTE7_ZERO","You'll have to answer to my master sooner or later, you worthless pile of scrap!"
"YETI1_ZERO","Zero. My master sees a part for you in his new ideal world."
"YETI2_ZERO","What do you Mavericks see in me? Aside from a potential beating, that is..."
"YETI3_ZERO","You truly are an old model, aren't you? You can't change the world with that thinking."
"YETI4_ZERO","Change the world? With destruction? Leave it to a Maverick to come up with that."
"YETI5_ZERO","Your world... Your ideals... they're incomprehensible to my master."
"VILE1-1_ZERO","Vile!"
"VILE1-2_ZERO","What do you plan to do with the Elevator and Lumine?"
"VILE1-3_ZERO","Lumine? Ha ha ha... Don't worry. We're taking very good care of him."
"VILE1-4_ZERO","The Orbital Elevator is too important to us to hurt the one who operates it."
"VILE1-5_ZERO","That toy's a little too complicated for Mavericks like you, Vile."
"VILE1-6_ZERO","Ha ha ha... How I've missed you, Zero."
"VILE1-7_ZERO","What do you say we have a little fun and make the most of this reunion?"
"VILE2-1_ZERO","Vile!"
"VILE2-2_ZERO","It's time to hand Lumine over. This time, I won't take No for an answer."
"VILE2-3_ZERO","Lumine? Are you so dim as to think you're in a position to make demands?"
"VILE2-4_ZERO","Look around you, fool! Your world has already begun to crumble!"
"VILE2-5_ZERO","The world as you know it? Mavericks? Kiss it all goodbye!"
"VILE2-6_ZERO","Mayhem, doom and destruction! That's what we were built for!"
"VILE3-1_ZERO","Don't you ever get tired of the whole \""justice\"" thing?"
"VILE3-2_ZERO","Don't you ever get tired of being Sigma's lap dog?"
"VILE3-3_ZERO","The Orbital Elevator... the energy... the space minerals... the rocket data..."
"VILE3-4_ZERO","The route to space..."
"VILE3-5_ZERO","The thing that's allowed this world to survive this long is ours!"
"VILE3-6_ZERO","How can you take this world seriously when it's all about to end?"
"VILE3-7_ZERO","Hmph! I think I'll take care of you before I go after your boss!"
"VILE4-1_ZERO","So, you still refuse to give up your struggle, eh?"
"VILE4-2_ZERO","Are you so blind that you've somehow convinced yourself that hope remains?"
"VILE4-3_ZERO","Struggle?"
"VILE4-4_ZERO","I'm just tired of running into you and Sigma every time I turn around."
"VILE4-5_ZERO","Ha ha ha... I suppose it'd be a waste to just destroy you now."
"VILE4-6_ZERO","Maybe I'll wait till the last possible moment and have a little fun with this."
"COPYSIGMA1_ZERO","Sigma!?"
"COPYSIGMA2_ZERO","Can't say I was looking forward to seeing you again."
"COPYSIGMA3_ZERO","Zero. What a shame... You had the abilities and potential to become like me."
"COPYSIGMA4_ZERO","You... you tried to use my DNA."
"COPYSIGMA5_ZERO","I'll teach you what happens when you mess with me!"
"COPYSIGMA6_ZERO","I'm afraid not. The moon is under my control and the plan is entering it's final stage."
"COPYSIGMA7_ZERO","The moment of the world's unraveling is upon us!"
"SIGMA1_ZERO","Zero... Who could have imagined that we'd cross paths at the end of the world."
"SIGMA2_ZERO","The moment your virus entered my system, the seed had been planted."
"SIGMA3_ZERO","That's when it all began... The destruction of the world!"
"SIGMA4_ZERO","I've heard about enough of this garbage, Sigma."
"SIGMA5_ZERO","Don't get angry, Zero. I'm actually indebted to you."
"SIGMA6_ZERO","It's because of you that my children were able to create this magnificent new world in space."
"SIGMA7_ZERO","Children?"
"SIGMA8_ZERO","That's right. The New Generation Reploids born of the Jakob Project all bear copy chips containing my personal data."
"SIGMA9_ZERO","Now, the plan to destroy the world you so love is finally coming to fruition!"
"SIGMA10_ZERO","I shed no tears for you and your kind!"
"SIGMA11_ZERO","The end of the world, and of you has come! Farewell!"
"SIGMA12_ZERO","Sigma... As long as I'm still in function, you won't get your happy ending!!!"
"FINALLUMINE1_ZERO","You're Lumine! The director of the Jakob Project. Are you okay?"
"FINALLUMINE2_ZERO","Am I OK...? Of course."
"FINALLUMINE3_ZERO","Now that you've defeated Sigma, I suppose you're satisfied."
"FINALLUMINE4_ZERO","Thanks to you, the plan has gone smoothly."
"FINALLUMINE5_ZERO","Plan? What do you mean by that? Weren't you used by Sigma's evil schemes?"
"FINALLUMINE6_ZERO","Used? I don't think so."
"FINALLUMINE7_ZERO","You see, he merely helped my plan along."
"FINALLUMINE8_ZERO","The New Generation Reploids have been awakened, and the new world is at hand!"
"FINALLUMINE9_ZERO","Lumine? What are you saying? Have you gone Maverick as well?"
"FINALLUMINE10_ZERO","Maverick? You don't really think that's the case, do you?"
"FINALLUMINE11_ZERO","That's why you can't finish me off, right? You don't have it in yourself...You aren't who should it be, am I right?"
"FINALLUMINE12_ZERO","Huh?"
"FINALLUMINE13_ZERO","Old models like you have to worry if your actions are truly your own."
"FINALLUMINE14_ZERO","Who knows what might be influencing you at this very moment? A Ghost perhaps?"
"FINALLUMINE15_ZERO","However, we New Generation Reploids were built using data derived from hundreds of old model Reploids."
"FINALLUMINE16_ZERO","That's what grants us total immunity to all viruses. We can act how we choose, as it guarantees our own free will!"
"FINALLUMINE17_ZERO","That means, of course, that Sigma was also included in the mix. Do you understand what I'm getting at here?"
"FINALLUMINE18_ZERO","No Reploid would choose to be insane like Sigma was!"
"FINALLUMINE19_ZERO","Yes, he rebelled against your world. Perhaps due to a virus."
"FINALLUMINE20_ZERO","Maybe Sigma was right after all. You are the origin of this, Zero."
"FINALLUMINE21_ZERO","Thanks to you that we New Generation Reploids are able to be what we are now."
"FINALLUMINE22_ZERO","You should thank us for letting all of us know how this world is rotten."
"FINALLUMINE23_ZERO","Humans using Reploids to perpetuate their accursed cycle of aggression..."
"FINALLUMINE24_ZERO","That's why our decision to wage battle against the old world was made consciously."
"FINALLUMINE25_ZERO","In other words, we possess the power to go Maverick at will!"
"FINALLUMINE26_ZERO","......"
"FINALLUMINE27_ZERO","Zero... Do you really have what it takes to stop us?"
"FINALLUMINE28_ZERO","You're merely a tool of the humans. Nothing but a tool of the old world..."
"FINALLUMINE29_ZERO","You think you can stand up in front of us with your Saber to those who have evolved this far?"
"FINALLUMINE30_ZERO","Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You don't even know what you're fighting for!"
"FINALLUMINE31_ZERO","Playing as a \""Hero\"" who doesn't seem to know that the end of your world has already begun!"
"FINALLUMINE32_ZERO","You think your actions are really for your so-called \""Justice\""? We're the true justice!"
"FINALLUMINE33_ZERO","The world is changing. Therefore, it's only natural that evolution takes its course!"
"FINALLUMINE34_ZERO","Now, line up to be exterminated, so I can end your suffering forever!"
"FINALLUMINE35_ZERO","Justice? Hero? And who said I fought for these purposes?"
"FINALLUMINE36_ZERO","I only fought for what I thought was right and for those who believe that hope exists."
"FINALLUMINE37_ZERO","You're the enemy here... And I won't hesitate slicing you down!"
"FINALLUMINE38_ZERO","Enemy, ally... This issue isn't so black and white."
"FINALLUMINE39_ZERO","Reploids, along with humanity, have irrevocably changed."
"FINALLUMINE40_ZERO","The nature of their existence has also changed. You are not needed in our new world!"
"FINALLUMINE41_ZERO","You can babble all you want, but I'm not going to let you get away with this!"
"SECRET2-1_ZERO","Welcome Zero, it's a pleasure to meet you for the first time."
"SECRET2-2_ZERO","Huh? Oh, thanks. You don't look like a Maverick just like the others."
"SECRET2-3_ZERO","I can feel something... Peaceful in your presence, who are you?"
"SECRET2-4_ZERO","How observant of you to notice so quickly."
"SECRET2-5_ZERO","I am Serenade."
"SECRET2-6_ZERO","You mentioned I'm different from others you faced before?"
"SECRET2-7_ZERO","That is because of my overwhelming power."
"SECRET2-8_ZERO","Overwhelming?"
"SECRET2-9_ZERO","Correct. My strength isn't about aggression. I've been training ever since I lost the title of UnderKing."
"SECRET2-10_ZERO","Now that you mentioned my presence, I feel that you're somehow.... Familiar."
"SECRET2-11_ZERO","Hmmm?"
"SECRET2-12_ZERO","Could be that.... You are the one destined to bring destruction to us?"
"SECRET2-13_ZERO","What? What do you know about me? Tell me right now!"
"SECRET2-14_ZERO","Why don't you fight me and find out?"
"SECRET2-15_ZERO","For twenty years, I've amassed power and refined my abilities. I choose you to be able to test them."
"SECRET2-16_ZERO","Serenade, right?"
"SECRET2-17_ZERO","Very well then, I accept your duel. Let's do it!"
"SECRET2-18_ZERO","So be it, come on Zero! Show me your strength as well!"
"SECRET2-19_ZERO","I truly believed my power would be enough to defeat you. It seems I was mistaken."
"SECRET2-20_ZERO","Now that I've observed your way of fighting better, you don't appear to be like \""him\""."
"SECRET2-21_ZERO","You share strong similarities, but you seem to know what you're fighting on."
"SECRET2-22_ZERO","Are you saying that there is a counterpart of me which is my opposite?"
"SECRET2-23_ZERO","Indeed, but I fear that he will be defeated by \""another warrior\"" just like me."
"SECRET2-24_ZERO","You fought beautifully, Zero. You truly were the strongest opponent that I've encountered in this world."
"SECRET2-25_ZERO","I wish I had something more to offer as a reward... but all I can give is my gratitude."
"SECRET2-26_ZERO","Heh, no need to worry about it. Just the fact that you weren't a Maverick makes me feel rewarded."
"SECRET2-27_ZERO","Perhaps we'll meet again, in another place... until then, farewell, Zero."
"SECRET2-28_ZERO","And remember, think about what you are really fighting for."
"SECRET2-29_ZERO","..."
"SECRET3-1_ZERO","Y... You!"
"SECRET3-2_ZERO","Oh, so it's you, you were fighting alongside Axl against us, weren't you?"
"SECRET3-3_ZERO","Don't move! This area is restricted to S Class Hunters, Hand over that data to me right now!"
"SECRET3-4_ZERO","Do you not get it yet? With this, we can hunt Mavericks more effectively than the Hunters ever could."
"SECRET3-5_ZERO","After all, you fought for so long. We could be a great help to you, but for a price of course."
"SECRET3-6_ZERO","Do you think facing the Mavericks is just a game? What would make a bounty hunter such as you think that way?"
"SECRET3-7_ZERO","Hmph, you really are an S-Class Hunter, aren't you?"
"SECRET3-8_ZERO","Why don't you face me, then? I want to see if you remain as merciless as always."
"SECRET3-9_ZERO","Shall we get things started?"
"SECRET3-10_ZERO","Tch, not bad.... For an old timer..."
"SECRET3-11_ZERO","If you dare to get in our way one more time, I won't hesitate to slice you into pieces again."
"SECRET3-12_ZERO","And Axl would be disappointed if he knew his mentor didn't learn from his mistakes."
"SECRET3-13_ZERO","Ha ha ha... Maybe you were right after all."
"SECRET3-14_ZERO","Next time we met, it won't be that easy. Farewell Zero.... And please, keep supporting my boy."
"SECRET3-15_ZERO","..."
"FINAL-6","Roger!"
"VILE4-6_AXL","Maybe I'll wait till the last possible moment and have a little fun with this."
